# BLAST-prediction
 
This repository is part of the construction of a machine learninig model that predicts a BLAST job's duration when used through SequenceServer 2.0.0

Currently, there is a working script (and complementary functions) that iterates over a directory with yaml files containing BLAST output information. The script extracts the information relevant to our model and includes it in a dataframe. Key skills in this Python script include: lists, dictionaries, use of date and time, functions, and pandas.
